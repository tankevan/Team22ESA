      <h2>User Characteristics</h2>
      <p>We surveyed 33 people on their thoughts towards conservation. Only 5% of those surveyed participates in conservation efforts regularly. The affinity diagram below seeks to understand what encourages/deters them from participating more in conservation efforts.</p>
      <h4>Affinity Diagram</h4>

The recent sightings of snakes in homes are also due to the destruction of their homes as we were unable to conserve their natural habitats, thus resulting in the to adapt and live in our homes.</td>

      <h4>User Personas</h4>
      <p>From the three group headings, we categorised the consumers into three distinct personas:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="persona-subheader">Enthusiastic</p>
          <p>She is very concerned about saving the environment and plays her part in daily conservation efforts. Our game does not target her.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="persona-subheader">Powerless</p>
          <p>He is aware of the need for conservation but feels that his individual effort to save the environment is not going to make an impact.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="persona-subheader">Disinterested</p>
          <p>He has no interest in saving the environment. Even if he does, he feels that it is not worth his time to make changes to his daily routine.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Quality Attributes</h4>
      <p>From this survey, we inferred some necessary quality attributes the game must have to fulfil our mission of encouraging environmentally friendly choices:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The game shall empower its users to make an impact on the environment</li>
        <li>The game shall instill in its users the idea that every individual's effort counts to making an environmentally friendly community</li>
        <li>Since the target audience is generally adverse towards conservation, the game shall be able to send across the message in a short time frame</li>
        <li>The game shall be designed to engage first and foremost, only then will it be able to educate</li>
      </ol>
