# Team 22 ESA


This is a repository containing the submission of our project for the Engineering Systems Architecture (ESA) course.

The System Definition Documents(SDDs) included are:

1. **Cover Page**: Team Number, Team Members, (Optional: Team Member Photos), Submission date, Course Name and Number, Team Name, Project Theme, ESD logo, Team logo

2. **Mission Statement**: A solution-neutral statement of the problem area and goal

3. **User Characteristics**: Affinity diagram based on at least 30 comments collected from interviews; Quality attributes; User persona

4. **Influence Diagrams**: Influence diagrams displaying a network of factors influencing the mission (the target success factor) and a path or pathways from the system intervention to the mission

5. **Operational Concept**: Single page artistic rendition of system in use, annotated with key features

6. **Use Cases and Scenarios**: At least five nominal and five off-nominal use cases, with priorities. Operational Description Templates for high priority use cases

7. **Design Alternatives**: Classification tree of design alternatives (research required); the importance of this step is to understand the key architectural decisions being made

8. **Scorecard**: Functional requirements and quality attributes, with weights, that the user will use to score alternative solutions

9. **Integrated Concepts**: Propose at least five divergent (fundamentally distinct) integrated concepts which fulfill the operational concept; provide five concept sketches with annotated features
10. **Concept Selection**: A Pugh matrix documenting how the scorecard was used to down-select to the final concept; Optional: present a hybrid design concept that dominates previous concepts

10. **Product Family and Release Schedule**: Identify core architecture and derivative possibilities

11. **Design Teams**: Chunk the design into discrete deliverables (sub-systems) and assign to at least three teams; Identify design dependencies; Display using a Design Structure Matrix

12. **Design Rules**: A set of rules (early design decisions) that permit teams to design independently; Alternatively, a timeline with milestones for the delivery of these design rules, with parallel activities outlined

13. **Modes of Operation**: Abstract functionality from use case sequences; Modes and sub-modes of system operation depicted with a state diagram. Modes can overlap with combinatorial numbers of possible states

14. **Non-functional Requirements**: Written list of ten non-functional requirements stated in testable form

15. **Requirements Allocation**: Allocation of non-functional requirements to chunked design
